This is a 15 puzzle game I made with html/css js.  You can hit the scramble button as many times as you like to scramble the puzzle.

Each scramble will perform 40 random moves.

You can select a color with the color picker and then hit "text color" or "tile color" to changed the colors of the puzzle.

Finally, you can hit the picture button to toggle a picture of a pretty owl and the puzzle background. I plan to add a gallery of photos to choose from soon.

Please enjoy!
